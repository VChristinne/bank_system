# Cashinator
*  This project implements a basic bank system with three types of accounts: **checking**, **saving**, and **investment**.  
*  Each account type has specific **tax rules**.
*  Access to an account is secured with a **password**.
*  The user interface is built using **ttkbootstrap**.
*  Account and client information, as well as transaction history, are saved in **JSON** files.
